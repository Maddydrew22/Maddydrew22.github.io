      <p>Maggie was a rescue dog that lived with us for most of my childhood.  Playing ball in the yard was always an adventure with  
        her around as it was a race to the ball everytime.  She's gone now, but my softball skills are a tribute to her and the
        race to every ball!.</p>

      <p>I came to Alma to Cheer.  Having three state title in high school, I knew that I wanted to be part of a college cheer team
        and Alma was top of my list.  I was recruited by several colleges, but Alma had the national recognition as the best small 
        college in the cheer nation, so the decision was easy. I now compete on the NCA team as weell as the STUNT team.  We have
        one NCA National Championship, one runner up and two runner up places in STUNT.</p>
